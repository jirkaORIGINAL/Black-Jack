## ü§ñ AI-Assisted Development

This project was developed in collaboration with Google's Gemini AI. 
The primary goal was to rapidly prototype and build a fully-functional, polished game that "just works" out of the box. 
Using an AI assistant allowed for an efficient workflow, going from concept to a complete, playable, 
and responsive product in a very short amount of time.
